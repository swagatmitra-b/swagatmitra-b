### About Me 🙋‍♂️ : 

#### *I'm a freshman at the National Institute of Technology Silchar. I'm mostly interested in Web Development, Machine Learning, DevOps and the IoT domain. I love learning about computers and electronics and pretty much everything about science and technology piques my curiosity. I'm looking forward to making significant open source contributions and growing as a developer. You're always welcome to reach out to me.*
